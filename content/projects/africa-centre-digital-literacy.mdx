# Building approachable tech literacy for newcomer seniors

We paired weekly in-person coaching with a lightweight set of AI co-pilots that *never* assumed perfect English or expensive hardware.

## What I built

- **Bilingual prompts** tuned for WhatsApp voice notes and low-data phones.  
- A rolling **support script** for volunteers that summarized common stumbling blocks each week.  
- Printed **micro-guides** that mirror the co-pilots so learners could toggle between paper and chat.  

## Outcomes and notes

- Learners increasingly requested translations rather than full walkthroughs, signalling confidence.  
- The most valuable feature was a **“show me, don’t tell me”** mode that returned annotated images instead of walls of text.  
- Future iteration: pair with on-device models to protect privacy for health or banking examples.
