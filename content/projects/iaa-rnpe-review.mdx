# Translating RNPE research into workshop-ready assets

The Institute of African Advancement asked for a literature review that would *inform action*, not just sit in a drive.

## Approach

- Structured the 25-page review into **three decision maps**: policy gaps, community priorities, and near-term pilots.  
- Ran **bilingual prep calls** with facilitators to pressure-test terminology and accessibility.  
- Packaged a **workshop kit** with slides, printable worksheets, and short facilitator prompts.  

## Result

The review now anchors a set of bilingual workshops and a pilot roadmap the institute can iterate with partners.
