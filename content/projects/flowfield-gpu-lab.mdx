# Flowfield GPU Playground

An experiment in keeping motion elegant and legible without melting batteries.

## Technical notes

- Noise-driven fragment shader with a capped DPR and throttled pointer updates.  
- Uses **react-three-fiber** with a single full-screen plane; uniforms handle density and wobble without re-meshing.  
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`, swapping in a static gradient for low-power scenarios.  

## Why it matters

Complexity lives in the shader, not in React state. This keeps the experience crisp while letting non-3D teammates tweak parameters from a simple control panel.
